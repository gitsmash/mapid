# Mapid MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product**: Mapid - Neighborhood Community Platform  
**Version**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
**Target Launch**: Q4 2024  
**Team**: Solo Developer  

**Vision**: Create a location-based community platform that helps neighbors connect, share resources, and build stronger local communities through an interactive map interface.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Fragmented Communication**: Neighbors use multiple platforms (Facebook groups, Nextdoor, Craigslist) with poor geographic relevance
2. **Discovery Issues**: Hard to find local events, sales, and services happening nearby
3. **Timing Problems**: Information about time-sensitive events (garage sales, restaurant specials) often discovered too late
4. **Geographic Irrelevance**: Existing platforms show content from too wide an area, reducing relevance
5. **Poor Mobile Experience**: Most local community platforms are not optimized for mobile discovery

### Target Users

- **Active Neighbors** (25-55): People who want to actively participate in their local community
- **Local Enthusiasts** (30-65): People who enjoy discovering local events, sales, and hidden gems
