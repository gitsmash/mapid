## Current Focus: T3 - Map Interface

### Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure map works well on mobile devices
2. **Category Filtering**: Allow users to filter posts by category on map
3. **Post Clustering**: Group nearby posts to improve map readability
4. **Location Notifications**: Alert users about new posts in their area

### Recently Completed:
- ‚úÖ Basic Leaflet.js integration
- ‚úÖ Post markers on map with popup details
- ‚úÖ Distance-based post filtering
- ‚úÖ Geospatial search functionality

### Blockers/Issues:
- None currently identified

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use TypeScript for frontend JavaScript
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Database
- Use Alembic for all schema changes
- Index all frequently queried columns
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Use PostGIS functions for geospatial queries

### Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Performance
- Optimize database queries (use EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Use lazy loading for large datasets
- Compress images and static assets

## Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Image Processing**: Current implementation is basic, needs S3 integration
2. **Error Handling**: Need more comprehensive error handling throughout app
3. **Testing**: Test coverage is currently low, need to add more tests
4. **Documentation**: API documentation needs to be created

### Medium Priority
1. **Code Organization**: Some modules are getting large, consider refactoring
2. **Configuration**: Environment configuration could be more robust
3. **Logging**: Need structured logging for better debugging
4. **Monitoring**: Add health checks and metrics collection

### Low Priority
1. **Type Hints**: Add type hints to improve code maintainability
2. **Code Comments**: Some complex algorithms need better documentation
3. **Dependency Management**: Review and update dependencies regularly

## Deployment Notes

### Development Setup
1. Install PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
2. Set up virtual environment with `uv`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
4. Run `flask db upgrade` to create tables
5. Start development server with `python app.py`

### Production Requirements
- PostgreSQL 14+ with PostGIS 3+
- Redis for caching and session storage
- AWS S3 for image storage
- SSL certificate for HTTPS
- Load balancer for high availability
